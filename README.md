# Hello, World! I'm Mandi Haase âœ¨

I'm a software engineer with a relentless love for learning, teaching, and creating innovative solutions. Currently residing near the vibrant city of Washington, DC, I balance my tech adventures with the joys of family life. When I'm not coding, you'll find me diving into captivating books with my kids, exploring new technologies, or sharing knowledge with fellow developers.
